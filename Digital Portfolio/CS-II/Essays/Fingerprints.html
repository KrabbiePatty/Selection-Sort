	  <p style="font-size:24px; text-align:center; text-color:orange;">Blake Gateley<br>Allen High School STEAM Campus<br>Advanced Computer Science 2<br>Mr. Ben-Yaakov<br>September 20, 2022</p>
	  <p>Before HTTPS came along, the internet relied on the insecure HTTP(GRC, 2020). However, it ended being replaced because of the increased privacy and security. It does this by encrypting data and authenticating connections(GRC, 2020). It authenticates through very trustworthy Certificate Authorities who sign digital certificates saying that a certain website is secure and trustworthy(GRC, 2020).<br><br></p>

	  <p>Eventually, it got to a point to where all connections could be encrypted in HTTPS, but not everyone wanted to do that. In order to bypass this encryption, the HTTPS Proxy Appliance, a method of creating a pseudo website certificate in order to decrypt the data between the browser and a website, was created. These Proxy Appliances could be considered a Man in the Middle intercepting data between two devices (GRC, 2020). A MITM would intercept any data transfered into the Proxy Appliance and view all of the data (GRC,2020).<br><br></p>

	  <p>While it's impossible to prevent interception, it is able to be reliably detected (GRC, 2020) because of the way these pseudo certificates are made, by checking the hash of the security certificate and comparing it to the authentic security certificate hash you can tell if the certificate is fake. Hashes are complex mathematical algorithms that process every single bit of information from the source (GRC, 2020). A good hash would be considered to be "new, strong, and secure" (GRC, 2020) in order to create the best representation of that data. If there is a match between the two, the connection is secure (GRC, 2020).<br><br></p>

	  <p>However, a website can have multiple certificates for different purposes which would cause a false positive when you check if your data is being intercepted, which could trick you into thinking it was not secure if you tried to verify that different hash with a more well known one. A false negative on the other hand, would be a Proxy Appliance tricking you into thinking that the webpage was not being intercepted (GRC, 2020).<br><br></p>

	  <p>I believe that governments should be able to eavesdrop on our connection within a certain extent. Outside of seeing if someone is commiting a crime, I believe that any other investigation into private matters is an overstep and them abusing their power.
